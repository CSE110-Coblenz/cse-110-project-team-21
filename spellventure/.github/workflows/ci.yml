# ============================================
# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline for Spellventure
# ============================================
# This workflow runs automatically whenever:
#   - Someone pushes to main
#   - Someone creates or updates a PR into main
#
#
# What it does:
#   1. Checks out the repository
#   2. Installs Node.js (consistent version for all teammates)
#   3. Installs dependencies (npm install)
#   4. Runs ESLint (fails CI if there are linting errors)
#   5. Builds the project (vite build)
# ============================================

name: CI

# Trigger conditions for the pipeline.
on: [push, pull_request]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # GitHub-hosted runner (Linux VM)

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repo into the CI machine
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Install Node.js and set it up with caching
      # This ensures all teammates and CI use the same Node version
      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 # You can change this later if needed
          cache: "npm" # Cache dependencies for faster CI

      # Step 3: Install dependencies from package.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run ESLint
      # If ESLint finds errors, CI fails and PR cannot merge
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Build the project.
      # This ensures the code compiles and Vite doesn’t error
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build --if-present
